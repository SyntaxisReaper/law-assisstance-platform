# üß™ Law Assistance Platform - Testing Guide

## üöÄ Quick Testing Setup

### Option 1: Test with In-Memory Database (Recommended for Quick Demo)

**Start Backend Test Server:**
```powershell
# Open PowerShell in the backend directory
cd C:\Users\ritsa\projects\law-assistance-platform\backend
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "node test-server.js"
```

**Start Frontend (in a new PowerShell window):**
```powershell
# Open another PowerShell in the frontend directory
cd C:\Users\ritsa\projects\law-assistance-platform\frontend
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "npm start"
```

### Option 2: Full MongoDB Setup

1. **Install MongoDB Community Server**: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
2. **Start MongoDB Service**
3. **Use the main server**: `node server.js` instead of `test-server.js`

   - Confirm Password: testpass123
4. Submit and verify you're redirected to dashboard

### **2. Report Analysis Testing**

**Test Different Report Types:**

**Emergency Report (Should trigger critical analysis):**
- Title: "Urgent medical emergency situation"
- Category: Medical Emergency

## üö® Emergency Testing

**Test Emergency Detection:**
Try submitting reports with these keywords to trigger emergency responses:
- "emergency" 
- "urgent"
- "bleeding"
- "unconscious"
- "assault"
- "violence"
- "suicide"
- "threatening"

Watch the backend console for emergency notification logs.

## üì± Mobile Testing

Test the responsive design:
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Toggle device toolbar
3. Test different screen sizes:
   - Mobile (375px)
   - Tablet (768px)
   - Desktop (1200px+)

## üîß API Testing

You can test the API directly using these curl commands:

**Health Check:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

**Register User:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"firstName\":\"Test\",\"lastName\":\"User\",\"email\":\"test@example.com\",\"password\":\"testpass\",\"phone\":\"+1-555-0123\"}"
```

**Login:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"email\":\"test@example.com\",\"password\":\"testpass\"}"
```

## ‚ö° Performance Testing

### **Load Testing Scenarios:**
1. **Multiple Users**: Test with multiple browser tabs/users
2. **Report Volume**: Submit multiple reports quickly  
3. **Concurrent Registrations**: Test multiple user registrations
4. **Emergency Scenarios**: Test emergency detection under load

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### **Backend Issues:**
- **Port 5000 in use**: Change PORT in test-server.js
- **CORS errors**: Verify frontend URL in CORS settings
- **Token issues**: Clear browser localStorage and re-login

### **Frontend Issues:**
- **Blank page**: Check browser console for errors
- **API connection fails**: Verify backend is running on port 5000
- **Styling issues**: Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured

### **Testing Issues:**
- **Data not persisting**: This is expected with test-server.js (in-memory storage)
- **MongoDB connection**: Use test-server.js for quick testing without MongoDB

## üìä Expected Test Results

After completing all tests, you should see:

1. **‚úÖ User Registration/Login**: Seamless account creation and authentication
2. **‚úÖ Report Intelligence**: Smart analysis of incident reports
3. **‚úÖ Emergency Detection**: Automatic identification of critical situations
4. **‚úÖ Service Matching**: Appropriate professional recommendations
5. **‚úÖ Professional UI/UX**: Modern, responsive, accessible design
6. **‚úÖ Security**: Secure authentication and data protection

## üéâ Demo Script

For a quick demonstration:

1. **Start both servers** (backend test-server.js and frontend)
2. **Register a new user**
3. **Submit an emergency report**: "I was just assaulted and am bleeding"
4. **Show the analysis results**: Critical severity, Emergency urgency, Police + Medical services
5. **Navigate to Emergency page**: Show immediate help resources
6. **View Services directory**: Show available professionals

This demonstrates the core value proposition: **intelligent incident analysis with automatic service matching for emergency assistance**.
